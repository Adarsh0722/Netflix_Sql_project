Hey there! üëã
This project is a hands-on SQL analysis of Netflix's content data using PostgreSQL. I tackled 15 real-world business questions that explore insights like content types, top genres, directors, countries, and trends over the years.

It was built entirely using PostgreSQL queries ‚Äî no external tools, just pure SQL muscle!

## Objectives

- Analyze the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows).
- Identify the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
- List and analyze content based on release years, countries, and durations.
- Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords.

## Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:
